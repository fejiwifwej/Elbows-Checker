# 🍺 Elbows Checker - The Ultimate Beer Cap Justice Tool 🍺

## 🎯 The Backstory (AKA Why This Exists)

Picture this: A friendly game of beer caps (beer pong but with bottle caps) turns into a full-blown CSI investigation. Your boy Ryan is being kind of a little pussy and not missing a fucking shot.  

So what do you do? You do the rational (and not salty thing) and start recording every single one of his shots on video, because you're convinced he's cheating by crossing the "elbow line" (the sacred boundary where elbows must not cross the table edge).

Then it happens. The moment of truth. You capture the PERFECT shot - Ryan's elbow is CLEARLY across the table line, cap still in hand, caught red-handed! You're about to expose this fraud to the group chat when...

**Ryan hits you with the classic defense: "The picture wasn't taken from a straight-on angle!"**

*Cue dramatic music*

So naturally, instead of just accepting defeat like a normal person, you decide to build an entire Python application to settle this dispute once and for all. Because that's what rational adults do.

## 🚀 What This Tool Does

This is your personal "Elbow Justice" machine. It takes any photo and:

1. **Perspective Correction**: Fixes wonky angles so you can prove your case with mathematical precision
2. **Line Drawing**: Lets you draw a red line exactly where the "elbow boundary" should be
3. **Evidence Export**: Saves your perfectly corrected image with the line for maximum group chat impact

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- A sense of petty justice
- The ability to hold a grudge

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository (if you haven't already):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fejiwifwej/Elbows-Checker.git
cd Elbows-Checker
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎮 How to Use (The Justice Process)

### Step 1: Load Your Evidence
- Click "Load Image" and select the incriminating photo
- The app will display your evidence in the main window

### Step 2: Fix That Wonky Angle
- Click 4 points on the image to define any rectangular area on the table surface:
  - Top-left corner of the area
  - Top-right corner of the area  
  - Bottom-right corner of the area
  - Bottom-left corner of the area
- Click "Apply Perspective Correction" to straighten the entire image based on that area
- Now Ryan can't claim "bad angle" anymore!

### Step 3: Draw the Line of Justice
- After perspective correction, click and drag to draw a red line exactly where the "elbow boundary" should be
- This is your smoking gun - the line that proves Ryan's elbow was across the table

### Step 4: Export Your Evidence
- Click "Save Image" to save your perfectly corrected image with the red line
- Share this masterpiece in the group chat and watch Ryan's excuses crumble

## 🎯 Pro Tips for Maximum Justice

1. **Be Precise**: Take your time marking the 4 points for perspective correction. Accuracy is key.
2. **Strategic Line Placement**: Draw your red line exactly where the table edge should be for maximum impact.
3. **Multiple Angles**: If one photo doesn't work, try different shots from different angles.
4. **Document Everything**: Save multiple versions with different line placements to cover all your bases.

## 🏆 Expected Results

After using this tool, you should be able to:
- Prove beyond reasonable doubt that Ryan's elbow was indeed across the line
- Silence all "bad angle" excuses forever
- Establish yourself as the group's resident "Elbow Justice Expert"
- Potentially start a new career in competitive beer cap refereeing
